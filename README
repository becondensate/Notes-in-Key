The key finding portion of the program is finished and works fine as long as the note_data.txt file is in the same directory.
The goal is to write the gui in Tkx to return keys based on notes the user picks. Combo boxes will be 
added for all 12 notes and the program will return a score for each key depending on how many 
checked notes match. The program will also return keys that have 1, 2, 3, etc accidentals.
The test programs were quick tests to see if something worked or not.
